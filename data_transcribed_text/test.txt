 As soon as I saw this story today, I knew I had to make a video about this because the CEO of Bank of America recently just came out and talked about how the economy is doing really great because the consumer is far more ahead financially than most people believe them to be. And I know I can't always get to your comments guys like there's videos that go by and I can't answer anybody's comments because I'm always busy working on the next piece of content for you guys. But in this video in particular, I want you to come.  and let me know if any of this stuff that I'm going to talk about here resonates with you or if this is true in your own life because I really want to get a feeling for how my viewers are feeling about things right now when it comes to their own financial situation. You don't have to share anything more than you want to, but I want to know if you can relate to all of this because one of the things that they're talking about here is how consumers still have a lot more money left over than we're being led to believe right now.  we've heard time and time again is how all of the pandemic savings have dried up, right? Well, the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, he says, no, no, no, no, no, that's not actually true because he's looking at the numbers of people who actually have Bank of America accounts, the tune of 60 million Bank of America accounts. He said during this year of 2023, we've seen four and a half trillion dollars leave people's bank accounts and that is a 9% increase between 2021 and 2022.  And that means people are still spending money. They still have money. And we saw this reflected in the Black Friday numbers. You know, Black Friday was fantastic. And it's not just YOLO spending that's going on in the economy. It's that people actually still have money. Okay, so how do you guys feel about that? Are you in this position? Do you still have a decent amount of money saved? Do you still have money to spend on extras? Besides just the basics that you need to have. The essentials, are you spending money on going out to dinner?  Are you spending money on buying a ton of Christmas presents? Just let me know guys and obviously I'm going to try to answer as many of these comments as I can. But I really want to know what's happening with you. And then he goes on to mention that well, you know, spending in November was up 4% compared to a year ago. So that's a sign that things are still doing well. Well, not really guys because inflation is pretty close to that number. So the amount of spending that's being spent in addition to what it was last year is just to keep up with the pace of inflation.  That's what I think personally. He also goes on to say that, you know, Cyber Monday was bigger than last year. Black Friday Bigger than last year. But you know, not big time bigger. We're talking three and a half to four percent bigger. According to Adobe Analytics, their data says that between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday that spending was actually up 7.8% year over year, which is double those previous figures and It was a total of 38 billion dollars just during that five-day stretch. The National Retail Federation is forecasting that holiday spending  will hit record levels, they're predicting anywhere between $957 to $966 billion, which coincidentally is a 3-4% increase over last year. So really, just to make up the difference of inflation, basically spending is probably going to be the same. But even if it's the same, that still would indicate that people are still doing well financially, right? Which is the point that Brian Moynihan is trying to make here. Now first of all, in October, it was found out people actually socked away more money  been previously reported during the pandemic. So it was reported that in October of 2023, consumers had about $400 billion left in savings. Well, it actually revised that number up to 1.2 trillion. So we're talking three times as much as what was previously reported. Therefore, they're saying, well, people still are flush with cash and this can still continue to go on even further, guys. But let me know if this is you or not. That's what I want to know. I just want to get a feeling for how many of my viewers  board with this and how many are actually feeling what they're saying right now. They're also talking about how wages are still increasing, but according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, okay, the real average hourly earnings only increased 0.8%, which is seasonally adjusted from October 2022 to October 2023. So you're talking less than a 1% increase when adjusted for inflation, guys. Is that really going to be enough to keep all this extra money in people's pockets? I personally don't think so. Thank you.  Brian Moynihan says people have money in their accounts. He says that people that had an average between $5 to $10,000 in their bank account, their balances have only come down by a small amount, which is about a 4% decrease. People that had $2,000 to $5,000 in their bank account have only taken a 1% hit. Virtually, nothing has changed as what he's trying to say in terms of how much money people have in the bank. So once again, is this you? Are you living on credit? Do you have money in the bank and doing it?  well. Now obviously a lot of this is going to depend on your age and how responsible you are with your income and how much money you make. You know those things make a big difference guys. I'm not blind to that. And here's what else Moynihan says. He says that you know people also have new credit options courtesy of their house is increasing in value. But inflation woes and the news are creating a distinction between perceived reality and consumers behavior. That's an interesting point because he's talking about how people have more.  credit options and he specifically named home equity as credit. Meaning that this is a source that people are pulling from right now to be able to survive in this economy. Guys, I talked about this in yesterday's video and we can kind of see this happening right now in real time with how much the refinancing activity winds up over this past week. You know, one up 14% from the prior week, guys, because rates came down. Who's refinancing from...  It's an 8% or 9% rate down to 7%. Practically nobody because 90% of all the mortgages that are being held out there right now Have an interest rate below 6% guys. So what's really happening is People are trading in the 6% mortgage rate or the 5% mortgage rate for the 7% mortgage rate and Sucking all the equity out of the house to pay for their lifestyle. That's what's really going on that you're never gonna hear reported in the mainstream media  And he's also saying that there's a disconnect between the way people feel right now and what their actions are actually telling us because he says that people are feeling like, oh, inflation is high, everything's more expensive. What I'm actually doing is I'm going to concerts, I'm spending money on entertainment. Bank of America says there's a  7% increase year over year on entertainment spending for 2023. So in that sense, the data reports that it's actually true that people are spending more money on this stuff, guys. And he says it's larger because people bought a bunch of stuff during the pandemic that they don't need to continue to go out and buy like a lot of these consumer goods. Now they're spending more of it on travel and entertainment. But what I find most interesting about this is, we have a lot of other data that contradicts everything that we just said here. And some of those things.  are, you know, we now have record credit card debt at $1.2 trillion and just think about this guy. Just a few months ago, it just reached the record of $1 trillion and now it's already up to $1.2 trillion meaning that the credit card debt has increased by 20% and just like the last three to four months. That is scary. And we have the linkancies on all forms of loans going through the roof right now, which we talked about a few days ago, we have the linkancies on auto loans on the rise. The linkancies on personal loans are on the rise.  and loans on the rise. The link when season credit cards on the rise. The link when season mortgages on the rise. So none of that stuff kind of lines up with people still having money because if they had the money, they wouldn't be the link went on their bills, right? We have unemployment taking up. It went from three and a half percent to three point nine percent recently. We also have crime going up, okay? That's something I'm noticing too. You're starting to see more and more stories about shoplifting and robberies and break ins. Things like that.  because people are getting desperate and they're looking for ways to get money guys. And so how are all these things signs that the average consumer is doing well right now? That's what I wanna know, which is why I want your guys' input on this to see what you see going on around you and what you feel happening in your own life. And another thing that kind of backs up what I just said as well about the economy and the consumer not doing as good as being reported is the jobs numbers just came in this week. And ADP reported just 103,000 new jobs.  jobs in November. Okay? Now that doesn't include government jobs and the government numbers are actually much higher. The government reported a 199,000 new jobs in November. So almost double. So literally half of that is government hiring, not private businesses. But the prediction for ADP payroll was 128,000 and it only ended up at 109. So it came in that under the predicted amount, which shows that the labor market is finally starting to soften, which is what the Fed wants.  the Fed wants this to happen. Another thing that ADP reported is they said that the economy has added 298,000 jobs since September, which is less than 100,000 jobs a month, and it's the weakest stretch since early in the pandemic in 2020. So this is starting to show you that the interest rates are starting to do its job, right? We're starting to see these interest rates take full effect on the economy in the form of less hiring. We're seeing it with layoffs as well, and eventually  that all translates into less spending in the future. Wow, a nice change of pace from yesterday's video. We actually have a house under contract that's actually selling. But when we dig deeper, they had to do a 25% price cut to get this house sold. They've been trying to sell it since January of 2023. Almost a year, guys, that's right. And it took them lowering it from $2 million all the way down to $1,590,000 to get a contract. Most likely, they're probably selling less than that, probably less than $1,590,000.  1.5 million, but they're finally selling it after a year of trying. And at least it's owner occupied so their property tax bills low, it only $4,200 per year. They also say in this ADP report that on average, workers have gained about a 5.9% increase in their pay in the past 12 months, but at the same time, that's the smallest gain that we have seen in the last three years. And just don't think it's enough to really keep up with the true cost of  living guys because on average even though they're saying inflation is only at like 3% right now whatever it is that just means things are 3% more expensive today than they were a year ago but this is continuing on a monthly basis you know so when you add all this up on average life is about 20 to 25% more expensive than it was pre-pandemic so that really adds up and are these increases going to be enough to really help people stay on track you know my guesses  probably not, but Brian Moynihan from Bank of America, he says yes and that things are still going to keep going like this for quite some time. Now Jim Grant, he's an economist that kind of predicted the 2008 great financial crisis that we saw and he's been watching the Fed and our economy for over 40 years. This guy has been really, he's really had his eye on the ball for a long time. Well he's saying that now that we've had interest rates for too low for too long, he's saying that the economy basically developed at the end of the year.  debt problem that's probably gonna end badly. Because the free money era is essentially over, this is going to cause a lot of problems in our economy. So he says in order to understand what's going on today that you have to go all the way back to 2008 and what the Fed started doing back then. Basically to save the economy, they went to a zero interest rate policy, they did a ton of quantitative using back then, nowhere near on the level that we saw during the recent pandemic, but still a lot for its time. They bought a bunch of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and it's unw devastating.  Eventually this started the free money era that we all got so accustomed to over the past 12 to 15 years. And what this did is it helped blow up the everything bubble that we're seeing happening right now. So his biggest concern are the credit markets, which we haven't really seen get hit yet by these higher interest rates. Today's referring to  is all of the refinance and it needs to happen, especially on commercial real estate. And these people can't afford it, guys. And we're already seeing problems with that. We're already seeing numerous accounts just this year of corporate bankruptcies going on the rise. We're seeing numerous accounts of owners handing back the keys of these big office buildings because refinancing is not an option because it would make the building completely unaffordable so they'd rather just get it back to the bank. That's happening right now. They said another way that we can see this happening.  is through all of the zombie companies. He used WeWork as a good example because WeWork was able to suck up all this cash and you know, basically lose money. It was a business that lost money for a very long time. And even though it was unprofitable, the business model was, well, we'll just keep getting more investors and keep getting this basically free money to keep this whole thing going until it doesn't work anymore. And fast forward to today, now that interest rates are much higher, they've had to close.  those down a bunch of locations and file for bankruptcy. And so he's saying that this is just the beginning of the first of many different companies that are gonna experience this. And you gotta understand guys, when more and more companies go out of business and go bankrupt, what does that do? It kills jobs, right? Creates layoffs. What's people in a bad position financially? As of September of 2023, so far we have seen 516 corporate bankruptcies, which is more than any full year that we've seen going all the way back to 2000.  2010 and bankruptcies just this year are up 30% from where they were a year ago and related to this one of my viewers Soren he sent me this chart that shows how Delinquent commercial real estate loans have now hit their highest level in a decade as well and look how much this is going up guys And the year's not even quite over yet Imagine where this is gonna end up in 2024 and 2025 because that's when most of this corporate debt is gonna be maturing and needs to be refinanced  This is not going to end well for these businesses and ultimately that's going to bleed over into the regular average day person's life. Mark Spitznago, he is the founder and chief investment officer of the private hedge fund, UNIVERSA Investments, and he said that the Fed's policies after the great financial crisis leading up to the pandemic have created the largest credit bubble in human history and we're living in a tender box economy right now because of this. We've never seen anything.  like this before and this is all basically just one big experiment. And here's what he said. We know that credit bubbles have to pop but we don't know when but we know that they have to. And I am totally on board with that guys. I 100% agree with this and that's why I listen to very smart people like this that have 40 plus years experience you know watching and monitoring our economy rather than just listening to a bunch of losers in the comments that think they know everything okay. I don't listen to people like that because things  that they say are not based on reality or facts or history. And I think a lot of people say things that they want to happen and don't actually talk about things that are actually happening in reality. And Jim Grant, he says that we're going to be in a period now of we're going to see interest rates higher for longer, not just for a few years, like a lot of people are thinking, but he's talking about for decades that we might see interest rates higher for longer. And this is just going to be the new norm. We might see some fluctuation here and there, but overall, he thinks interest rates are going to stay high.  high indefinitely because he said when you look at long historical trends of interest rates that they typically tend to trend up or down for generations. So you're talking probably like a 20 year stretch potentially of interest rates remaining higher, potentially going even higher. He said this could last 40 years. I mean, I don't know. That sounds kind of crazy to me even, but hey man, this guy, you know, has been watching the economy since before I was even alive. So I think it's worth listening to what he has to say. Now of course, he says the big problem.  is what happens if we have a recession while the feds likely to drop the interest rates through the floor, but after that they're going to raise them back up again. So even if there is a big panic from the fed and they drop rates that they're going to have no choice but to raise them back up after that due to more inflation. And I agree, I agree with that sentiment as well. You know, gone are the days of being able to keep interest rates at near zero for decades at a time. So the days are over, I think that ship has sailed probably for a very long time.  Because the only way we could go back to that at this point is if we're willing to accept hyperinflation in this economy. In fact, one thing that could be coming next from all of this is deflation, which I'm not going to get into much here. But if that happens, then we could see a stretch of time when the cost of everything is starting to go down. And why would that be happening? Well, it actually could be happening because demand for things is drying up, guys. When this usually happens, it usually means it's because we're in a recession. But the only account of our economy is that we're in a recession.  to all of this because we have all this AI and all this new technology developing at rapid pace right now that this technology is actually deflationary because it increases productivity and it helps lower the price of goods and services with this technology and so they're saying that this could be something that actually helps stabilize the economy in the future. We actually have another one here that just sold like a couple weeks ago for 1.9 million but not without taking a 13.5% price  and sitting on the market for like six months. They listed it back in May of 2023 for $2.2 million, several price cuts later. They finally got it sold for $1.9 million guys. That's what it takes to get a house sold in this market right now is substantial price cuts. Property tax bill here is also $15 grand a year. So when I hear these things, honestly, I don't really know who to believe, guys. Like, you know, on the one hand, if people actually have more money, then originally thought maybe this whole story.  can go on for longer if people actually have the money to spend. But if that ends up being fake news and people actually don't have the money, they're more likely to see things falter pretty substantially over the next year or year and a half. But overall I hope you guys are doing well, I hope you have enough money to pay your rent and pay your bills, pay your mortgage, and still have some money left over for fun because after all, you know, what's the point of living if you don't?
